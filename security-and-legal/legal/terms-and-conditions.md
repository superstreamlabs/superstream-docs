These terms of service (the "Terms") together with any other agreements or terms incorporated by reference, govern the use of the Services. These Terms constitute a binding and enforceable legal contract between Company and any party (the "Customer") entering into an order form incorporating these Terms by reference (an "Order") or otherwise using the Services.&#x20;

1. Services; License&#x20;
   1. Subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms, and any applicable Order, Company shall provide Customer with services detailed in the Order ("Services") through its proprietary technology as hosted on a third party cloud service (the "Platform"), in accordance with the service level agreement available at https://superstream.ai/legal/service-level-agreement.&#x20;
   2. During the Term and subject to Customer’s compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Company grants Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, limited, revocable right (i) for Customer employees, agents, representatives and contractors who are permitted access to the Services by Customer ("Authorized Users") to access the Platform, for Customer’s internal business use, and up to such number of licenses set forth in the Order; provided by Company to enable the Services according to Company’s instructions and technical documentation provided by Company from time to time ("Documentation").&#x20;
2. Customer’s Obligations. Customer hereby undertakes to:
   1. implement the software provided by Company according to the Documentation;
   2. provide Company with complete and accurate information necessary to implement the Service. Customer acknowledges and agrees that the accuracy of the Services depends on the quality, completeness and timeliness of the data provided to Company, and on Customer providing Company with prompt notice upon any changes in required information;
   3. use the Platform, the Services, and all related software and Documentation in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to applicable data security and privacy laws;
   4. manage and secure all login credentials used by Authorized Users in connection with their use of the Platform and protect the same against unauthorized use or disclosure using reasonable standard in the industry.

All payments not made when due, shall be subject to a late charge of 1.5% per month compounded annually. Payment of Fees shall be made by wire transfer to the account designated by Company. The Fees are exclusive of VAT. In the event that Customer is required by law to deduct and/or withhold any amounts from any payments due hereunder, it shall gross-up and increase the amounts to be paid to Company so that the actual net amount to be paid to Company shall equal the fees that would have been due to Company without such deduction or withholding.
4. Intellectual Property Rights; Confidentiality&#x20;
   1. All intellectual property rights in the Platform, Services, Documentation, all related software and any part thereof, including any and all derivatives, changes and improvements thereof lie exclusively with Company.

Customer shall take no action, directly or indirectly, to register Company trademarks (or their variation), domain names, or copyrights in its own name and shall provide commercially reasonable assistance to Company to prevent the occurrence of such activity by any third parties. All intellectual property rights, as well as any data, materials or Confidential Information, including any modifications, enhancements and derivatives thereof (collectively, “Customer IPR”) lie exclusively with Customer or its licensors.&#x20;
   2. Customer hereby grants to Company: (a) a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, revocable, non-transferable, royalty-free, worldwide license during the Term to use, reproduce, and prepare derivative works of all data provided to Company by Customer in connection with this Agreement solely to permit Company to perform the Services to Customer as set forth in this Agreement, and (b) a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, revocable, non-transferable, royalty-free, worldwide license to analyze anonymized data obtained through Services in order to provide Customer with analytics and reports, and improve the Services, all subject to Company’s compliance with applicable law and privacy regulations.    &#x20;
   3. The receiving party agrees (i) not to disclose the disclosing party’s Confidential Information to any third parties other than to its directors, employees, advisors, or consultants (collectively, its “Representatives”) on a “need to know” basis and provided that such Representatives are bound by confidentiality obligations not less restrictive than those contained herein; (ii) not to use or reproduce any of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information for any purposes except to carry out its rights and responsibilities under this Agreement; (iii) to keep the disclosing party’s Confidential Information confidential using at least the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information, which shall in any event not be less than a reasonable degree of care. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the receiving party is required by legal process or applicable law, rule, or regulation to disclose any of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information, then prior to such disclosure, if legally allowed, receiving party will give prompt notice to the disclosing party so that it may seek a protective order or other appropriate relief.  The confidentiality obligations hereunder shall expire five years from the date of termination or expiration of this Agreement (and with respect to trade secrets- in perpetuity) and shall supersede any previous confidentiality undertakings between the parties. &#x20;
   4. For the purposes hereof, "Confidential Information" means any proprietary or trade secret information disclosed by one party to the other which can be reasonably understood under the circumstances to be confidential, but excluding any information that: (i) is now or subsequently becomes generally available in the public domain through no fault or breach on the part of receiving party; (ii) the receiving party can demonstrate in its records to have had rightfully in its possession prior to disclosure of the Confidential Information by the disclosing party; (iii) the receiving party rightfully obtains from a third party who has the right to transfer or disclose it, without default or breach of this Agreement; (iv) the receiving party can demonstrate in its records to have independently developed, without breach of this Agreement and/or any use of or reference to the Confidential Information.
