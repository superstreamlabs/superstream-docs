## Overview

### Kafka Optimization. Automated. End-to-End.

Superstream is a fully automated optimization platform for Apache Kafka that continuously analyzes and tunes both your clusters and clients. It helps engineering teams reduce cloud costs, improve reliability, and eliminate Kafka configuration drift‚Äîwithout needing deep expertise or manual intervention.

### Key Features & Benefits

#### üîß SuperCluster ‚Äì Intelligent Cluster Optimization

* **Daily Health Scans**: Automatically inspects topic configs, consumer groups, partition distribution, and usage patterns to identify inefficiencies.
* **Auto-Remediation**: Safely fixes misaligned topic configurations, replication factor issues, and skewed partitions‚Äîwith full audit logging and optional manual review.
* **Cluster Right-Sizing**: Evaluates actual broker resource consumption to recommend optimized MSK or Aiven plans, including automated safe rebalancing.
* **Inactive Resource Cleanup**: Identifies and optionally removes idle topics and consumer groups, reducing clutter and resource waste.
* **Topic Configuration Policies**: Enforce standardized settings for critical configs like `retention.ms`, `cleanup.policy`, and `replication.factor` to prevent drift.

#### üöÄ SuperClient ‚Äì Kafka Client Tuning Without Code Changes

* **Real-Time Observability**: Monitors producer behavior, including batching, compression, and throughput per topic and environment.
* **Smart Configuration Suggestions**: Recommends optimal settings like `batch.size`, `linger.ms`, and `compression.type` based on actual workload characteristics.
* **Broker Load Reduction**: Minimizes CPU and memory pressure on Kafka brokers by making clients more efficient at the source.
* **Instrumentation-Based Delivery**: Requires no application code changes‚ÄîSuperClient acts as a sidecar to inject optimizations securely and transparently.
* **Daily Analysis Cycle**: Workload tuning happens daily; changes are applied on next application startup or redeploy.

### Getting Started

1. Deploy Superstream agents within your infrastructure using a Helm chart.
2. Connect Kafka Clusters: Establish secure connections between Superstream and your Kafka clusters, ensuring proper authentication and permissions.&#x20;
3. SuperCluster analyzes and remediates cluster inefficiencies daily.
4. SuperClient observes producer workloads and delivers tailored configuration sets.

‚ÄúSuperstream took a huge load off our plates. We used to spend hours tuning Kafka and manually managing cost optimizations. Now it just works in the background‚Äîsmart, safe, and way more efficient.‚Äù **Ilay Simon, Sr. DevOps Engineer // Orca Security**

‚ÄúWe plugged Superstream in, and within days, it started surfacing config issues and cost sinks we had no idea existed. The auto-tuning is legit‚Äîperformance went up and our network overhead dropped noticeably.‚Äù **Shem Tov Fisher, Kafka Staff Engineer // Solidus Labs**

‚ÄúI was skeptical at first, but Superstream quickly proved its value. It understands our workload patterns better than we do and keeps our Kafka lean without us lifting a finger. It‚Äôs like having another engineer on the team.‚Äù **Ami Machluf, Data Engineering TL // eToro ($ETOR)**
