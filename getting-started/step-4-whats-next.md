# Step 4: What's next

Congratulations on reaching this stage!

## Here is what's happening now -&#x20;

* Superstream performs ongoing analysis of your clusters to highlight system insights, diagnose health problems, and recommend performance optimizations.
* The first batch of insights will be available within couple of minutes.
* While the Superstream local agent is connected to your clusters, the system continuously samples data on an hourly and daily basis to refresh insights and optimization recommendations.
* When automation is configured, SuperClient and SuperCluster will automatically initiate fixes for any detected issues.
