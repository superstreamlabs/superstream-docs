### Step 2: Fill in cluster details

Each vendor has a slightly different connection approach

#### Confluent Cloud / AWS MSK / Aiven

Automatic cluster discovery will initiate once an API key is provided.\
Metrics will be collected via the vendor API.

#### Redpanda / Apache (Self-hosted)

No automatic cluster discovery. Each cluster should be added manually. \
To enable metric collection in Superstream, a JMX connection must also be configured.

### Step 3: Verify that all discovered or added clusters are in a healthy state

When clusters are added or discovered, the system may surface warnings related to permissions or network connectivity. Itâ€™s recommended to resolve these promptly to ensure proper functionality.
