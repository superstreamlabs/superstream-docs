# Step 3: Activate

Congratulations! Reaching this step means that all your clusters are well connected and continuously being analyzed and monitored by Superstream.

Here is what we are going to do next:

2. Optimize Superstream automation for each cluster to align with its specific business logic.
3. Activate Superstream automation

### **Let's start:**

#### 1. Configure Superstream notifications

In Superstream Console -> Settings -> System Settings

Let's take "**Inactive topics cleanup**" as an example.
