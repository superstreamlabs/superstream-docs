# Overview

Clients play a vital role in your streaming environment, and Superstream enables you to control, govern, monitor, and optimize them for improved efficiency, throughput, and reliability.

Eligible for customers with "Client optimization" module.

### Control your clients

With Superstream, you can instantly modify properties on any connected client without the hassle of coordinating.

### Govern your clients

When scaling, it can be challenging to maintain the pace and control how your applications are configured to work with Kafka. Every property can greatly affect both your throughput and the stability of your system, whether it is a managed Kafka or not.

With Superstream, you can specify how each type of application should be configured, receive notifications if it is not, and, if necessary, overwrite the initial configuration with the desired one.
