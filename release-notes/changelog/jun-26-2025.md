Here’s what’s new, fixed, and improved across the Superstream platform in this release.

***

#### 🐛 Bug Fixes

* Fixed a **request reduction miscalculation** that was skewing optimization metrics.
* Resolved an issue where **topic filtering didn't update** the Connected Clients view correctly.

  * Added a prominent **“+ Add Agent”** button.
  * Now displays **agent version** and flags if **an update is needed**.
* **Dashboard & Agents Headers** are now sticky for easier navigation.
* Cleaned up UI:
  * Removed the unused “Stepper”.
  * Updated inconsistent labels:
    * `Kafka360` → `supercluster`
    * `super-client` → `superclient`
    * `Inter cluster` → `Inter-cluster` (chart title)
    * Chart labels: `Produced bytes` → `Transfer In`, `Consumed bytes` → `Transfer Out`
* Clients Table:
  * Now **sorts by newest clients first**.
  * Aligned headlines and tables across the console for consistency.
  * Updated instruction text to “**Add Clients**” and replaced the AI icon with a more relevant one.
* Cluster/Topic Filters:
  * Sorted lists so the **selected item appears first** (e.g. Priceline).
* New Cluster Flow Enhancements:
  * **Placeholders shown** across all cluster components.
  * Streamlined flow: “+ Add a Cluster” opens a drawer to select an existing agent or add a new one.
* Client Drawer:
  * Added a **bar chart showing before/after reductions** in message size, request count, and traffic.
