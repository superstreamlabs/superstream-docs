# Superstream

### Kafka Optimization. Automated. End-to-End.

Superstream is a fully automated optimization platform for Apache Kafka that continuously analyzes and tunes both your clusters and clients. It helps engineering teams reduce cloud costs, improve reliability, and eliminate Kafka configuration drift—without needing deep expertise or manual intervention.

### ⚙️ Cluster Optimization with SuperCluster

Superstream inspects your cluster daily to detect misconfigurations, inactive topics, idle consumer groups, and inefficient resource usage. It then applies right-sized recommendations or automatically remediates issues like over-provisioned brokers or misaligned topic settings.

### 🚀 Client Optimization with SuperClient

Zero-Code Client Tuning for Maximum Efficiency.\
By observing Kafka producer behavior in real time, Superstream suggests and applies optimized client-side settings—such as batching, compression type, and linger. This can reduce compute and data transfer costs by up to 60%, without requiring any code changes

### 🔒 Reliable, Automated, and Fully Controllable

Observability-First with Optional Automation.\
Whether you prefer to review changes manually or turn on full auto-remediation, Superstream offers flexible automation settings, audit logs, and detailed reports—giving you complete control and confidence in every optimization.
