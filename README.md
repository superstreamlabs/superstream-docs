# Superstream

### Data Teams Are Drowning In Operations

Instead of focusing on innovation, improvements, and AI initiatives,\
They are stuck with managing costs, performance, and security.

**Today**

* Months of human hours
* Millions in wasted costs
* Growth initiatives are not prioritized

**With AI**

:white\_check\_mark: No more operations

:white\_check\_mark: Growth initiatives are prioritized

## Meet Superstream

A team of localized AI agents that autonomously operate data infrastructure so  human data engineers would focus on what matters, not operations.

#### Common use cases:

* Reduce Kafka Usage Costs: Optimizing your cluster resources to align with your workload can cut costs by up to 80%.
* Increase Control: Enforce best practices and get valuable insights to ensure your Kafka runs at peak health.
* Avoid Migrating To A Different Kafka: Migration is often driven by cost or visibility—now, you can have both with your current vendor.
* Reduce Transfer Costs: By sampling your payload, Superstream can analyze and benchmark it to recommend ways to reduce the transfer footprint.
