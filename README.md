# Superstream

## The problem

Engineering teams often lack the time, expertise, or tooling to optimize Kafka costs effectively. Cost reduction requires deep visibility into low-level internals, analyzing complex usage patterns over time, safely experimenting without risking data, accurately forecasting capacity needs, and building custom scripts — all of which demand a level of maturity and focus most teams can't afford amid competing priorities.

## Introducing Superstream

Superstream AI Platform Helps Kafka Users Easily, Safely, and Automatically Improve Their Very Own Apache Kafka Cost Efficiency by up to 90%.

#### Common use cases:

* Reduce Kafka Usage Costs: Optimizing your cluster resources to align with your workload can cut costs by up to 80%.
* Increase Control: Enforce best practices and get valuable insights to ensure your Kafka runs at peak health.
* Avoid Migrating To A Different Kafka: Migration is often driven by cost or visibility—now, you can have both with your current vendor.
* Reduce Transfer Costs: By sampling your payload, Superstream can analyze and benchmark it to recommend ways to reduce the transfer footprint.
