# Superstream

## Welcome aboard!

Superstream AI-Workforce helps companies of all sizes boost data engineering productivity and offloads three main infrastructure challenges in the modern streaming stack: Workload optimization, control, and security, starting with Kafka of all flavors.

### Superstream for Kafka

* Costs: Reduce usage costs by up to 80%. That includes the storage, computing, reading, and writing.
* Control: Resolve issues faster than ever. Superstream agents will cross inputs and metadata from various locations to identify current or potential risks and anomalies and ensure you pay attention to what matters now or in the near future.
* Security: Data masking, BYOK, and temp visibility.

#### Common use cases:

* Reduce Kafka Usage Costs: Optimizing your cluster resources to align with your workload can cut costs by up to 80%.
* Increase Control: Enforce best practices and get valuable insights to ensure your Kafka runs at peak health.
* Detect Issues Faster: Superstream automatically identifies the root cause by analyzing multiple factors and signals.
* Avoid Migrating To A Different Kafka: Migration is often driven by cost or visibilityâ€”now, you can have both with your current vendor.
* Reduce Transfer Costs: By sampling your payload, Superstream can analyze and benchmark it to recommend ways to reduce the transfer footprint.
* Tiered Storage Enabler: Reduce storage costs by using Superstream to enable and manage your tiered storage policy.
