# Superstream

## Auto-Optimize Your Kafka Clusters & Clients

Superstream Automates Any Kafka Cost Efficiency, Configuration, Clients, And Traffic—so The Operators Won't Have To.

#### Reduce network size and cost

Automatically apply the most cost-efficient compression strategy for each client based on workload characteristics.

#### Enforce configuration and avoid drifts

Aligns clusters and clients' configuration to best practices or a custom one.

#### Clean up wasted resources

Finds & removes zombie topics, partitions, idle CGs, and connections.

#### Auto-tune clients for max efficiency

Automatically finds the optimal producer properties per workload.

### SuperClient for Kafka: Auto-Tune Your Kafka Clients For Efficiency & Governance

SuperClient for Kafka eliminates guesswork by tuning each client’s config to its unique workload—driving performance gains, cost savings, and reduced network usage.

✅ No Code Changes

There is no way we will ask someone to change their code! You just need to add a package or instrument your app.

✅ Deep Observability

Perfect enhancement for easier, faster issue identification and resolution.

✅ Dynamic Configuration

No more static, one-size-fits-all configuration. Superclient will dynamically auto-tune your client's config to match the current workload.

✅ Client Governance

Ensure your clients run with your defined policies and best practices.

### SuperCluster for Kafka: Keep Your Kafka Clusters Lean & Mean

SuperCluster for Kafka continuously cleans up and optimizes your cluster-level resources, making sure you pay and store what you actually use and need.

✅ Clean unused resources

Automatically detect and clean inactive topics, idle consumer groups, and more.

✅ Right-size your cluster

Continuously analyze workloads to scale your brokers up or down, avoiding waste without risking performance.

✅ Continuous and automatic

SuperCluster for Kafka runs in the background—constantly monitoring, optimizing, and enforcing best practices without manual intervention.
