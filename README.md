# Superstream

## Welcome aboard!

Superstream is an autonomous platform designed to optimize data infrastructure for cost reduction and reduced operations.

### Superstream for Kafka

Kafka needs to be cheaper, faster, and more reliable to process a greater volume of data in the near future.

Achieving these benefits usually requires replacing the existing Kafka with a managed one or a different vendor, which is a time-consuming, expensive, and painful process.

Superstream effortlessly integrates with any given Kafka of any provider through its API, continuously fetches and analyzes various metadata from the connected Kafka clusters and their clients with a proprietary library, and surfaces and applies enhancements to improve performance, minimize expenses, and reduce operational complexities.

Immediate outcome with zero efforts:

* Maintain cost efficiency while your data increases
* Improve reliability
* Decrease end-to-end latency by 6X, and improve throughput by 10X
* Enforce client-level governance and policies
